# ai-life-skills

A collection of skills I use with Claude Code to improve my life in various ways. Designed to pair with an AI-managed Obsidian vault — the skills read from and write to the vault.

## Skills

- [`summarize/`](./summarize) — drop in a YouTube video, article, PDF, EPUB, or podcast and it writes a summary note into your vault with wikilinks to every person and concept mentioned. Asks detailed vs minimal mode on each run — detailed creates reference notes for every wikilink, minimal leaves them dangling and saves ~85% tokens.
- [`creator-digest/`](./creator-digest) — turns `summarize` into a scheduled feed. List the channels, people, and topics you follow in one vault note; every few days it finds their new videos itself (no pasted links), fetches transcripts with scripts, and writes a compact takeaway digest. Mark a channel `deep` for full `/summarize` notes. Capped and script-driven so it stays cheap.
- [`summarize-call/`](./summarize-call) — drop in a call recording (video or audio) and it transcribes with speaker labels, summarizes, and writes a call note + transcript + person notes for the participants. Same detailed / minimal mode as `summarize`.

## Daily Briefs 

Two prompt-callout templates land in your vault under `01 Updates/` after install:

- **`📌 Daily Brief.md`** — your day's calendar, email, messages, tasks, weather. Sections + sources are configurable in the prompt callout.
- **`📰 Daily News.md`** — one-page news digest, top story per topic. Topics + languages configurable in the prompt callout.

These aren't skills — they're files with `> [!prompt]` callouts that contain the agent instructions. The agent reads the callout and follows it. Customize by editing the callout in Obsidian.

To run an update, paste either of these into Claude Code:

```
update my daily brief — read the prompt callout in "01 Updates/📌 Daily Brief.md" and follow it

update my daily news — read the prompt callout in "01 Updates/📰 Daily News.md" and follow it
```

For an automatic daily run, set up a recurring task:
- **`/loop`** — runs locally on your machine (machine has to be on at the scheduled time)
- **`/schedule`** — runs in the cloud (works while your machine is off on their servers)

## Scheduling the creator digest

1. Copy `vault/01 Updates/📺 Creator Feed.md` into your vault (easy-mode install does this) and fill in the `watchlist` block.
2. Try it once by hand: `/creator-digest dry-run`, then `/creator-digest`.
3. Schedule it. Prefer **`/loop`** (local): the digest needs `yt-dlp` and, for `subscriptions: true`, your browser cookies, and YouTube often blocks cloud IPs. Example: `/loop 3d /creator-digest`. `/schedule` (cloud) only suits public channels and may hit bot checks.

Control cost with `max_videos` in the watchlist (default 6 per run). Read the digest, then say `deep <title>` on anything worth a full note.

## Optional Obsidian plugins

Two Obsidian plugins that pair well with the skills — see [`obsidian-plugins/`](./obsidian-plugins) for details:

- **unread-dot** (vendored in this repo) — blue dot next to notes with `unread: true` in frontmatter. The summarize skills set this flag on every new note, so this plugin gives you a visual "you have new stuff" indicator in the file explorer.
- **flashcards-obsidian** (vendored in this repo) — turn `==highlighted==` text, `Question::Answer` syntax, or `#card` tags into Anki cards. Fork of [reuseman/flashcards-obsidian](https://github.com/reuseman/flashcards-obsidian). Requires Anki + AnkiConnect.

## Install — easy mode

Open Claude Code in any directory and paste this:

```
Install the ai-life-skills pack from https://github.com/reysu/ai-life-skills. Clone the repo to ~/src/ai-life-skills, ask me where I want the new Obsidian vault to live, create the vault folder with the full folder structure the skills expect, symlink every skill in the repo (`summarize`, `summarize-call`, `creator-digest`) into ~/.claude/skills/, copy vault/CLAUDE.md from the repo to the new vault's root, copy the daily-brief and daily-news prompt-callout templates from vault/01 Updates/ into the vault's 01 Updates/ folder, and ask me whether to also install the bundled unread-dot Obsidian plugin into the vault's .obsidian/plugins/ folder.
```

Claude will:
1. Clone the repo
2. Ask where to put the vault (default: `~/ai-vault`)
3. Create the vault folder with the expected structure (see below)
4. Symlink `summarize` and `summarize-call` into `~/.claude/skills/`
5. Copy the person-note template into your vault's `_Templates/` folder
6. Copy `vault/CLAUDE.md` to your vault root (so AI agents know your vault's conventions)
7. Copy `📌 Daily Brief.md` and `📰 Daily News.md` into your vault's `01 Updates/` folder
8. Optionally install the `unread-dot` Obsidian plugin into your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/`

Restart Claude Code so it picks up the new skills. Then run `/summarize` or `/summarize-call`.

> **Recommended: use a new, dedicated Obsidian vault** for these skills rather than your existing personal vault. The skills create and modify many notes/folders automatically, and keeping it separate avoids polluting notes you've written yourself.

### If you already have an Obsidian vault

You can point the skills at an existing vault if you want — tell Claude the path instead of creating a new one and it'll only create any missing folders. Just note the recommendation above about a dedicated vault.

## Install — individual skill only

If you just want one skill and already have a vault:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/src
git clone https://github.com/reysu/ai-life-skills ~/src/ai-life-skills
ln -s ~/src/ai-life-skills/summarize ~/.claude/skills/summarize
# or:
ln -s ~/src/ai-life-skills/summarize-call ~/.claude/skills/summarize-call
ln -s ~/src/ai-life-skills/creator-digest ~/.claude/skills/creator-digest   # also needs summarize
```

The skills share a `templates/` folder at the repo root — leave it where it is, both skills reference it with a relative path.

## Usage

### Summarize a video, article, PDF, or book

```
/summarize https://youtube.com/watch?v=...
```

Summary length is proportional to source length — a 10-minute video gets a short summary, a 3-hour podcast gets a long one, a 600-page book gets chapter-by-chapter treatment. Quotes and a link to the transcript go in the frontmatter.

For a book or PDF, drop the file into your vault first (I use `_Attachments/`) then call the skill with the filename:

```
/summarize The Singularity Is Near.epub
```

### Summarize a call

Drop the recording anywhere and call the skill with the path:

```
/summarize-call ~/Downloads/call-with-alex.mp4
```

It'll ask whether to transcribe locally (free, private, slower — walks you through installing whisper and pyannote if you don't have them) or with ElevenLabs Scribe (paid, faster, one API call). Then it writes a call note, the transcript, and person notes for the participants.

### Depth flags (both skills)

Both skills ask "detailed or minimal?" on each run. To skip the prompt — useful for scheduled tasks, `/loop`, or just typing faster — pass the mode in the invocation:

```
/summarize https://youtube.com/... minimal
/summarize https://youtube.com/... detailed
/summarize-call ~/call.mp4 --minimal
/summarize-call ~/call.mp4 -d
```

Accepted tokens:
- **Minimal**: `minimal`, `fast`, `quick`, `--minimal`, `-m`
- **Detailed**: `detailed`, `deep`, `full`, `--detailed`, `-d`

If neither is present, the skill prompts interactively. There's no default — you either pass it or pick when asked.

**What the modes do**:
- **Detailed**: creates reference notes for every wikilink in the output, person notes for every person mentioned (researches public figures), uses the highest-quality model available
- **Minimal**: writes the summary/call note only, leaves wikilinks dangling, creates person notes for creators/guests (or call participants) only, uses Sonnet — saves ~85% on tokens for typical content

## Vault structure

```
your vault/
├── 01 Updates/
├── 02 Daily/YYYY/MM/   # daily notes, named MM-DD-YY ddd.md
├── 03 Meetings/        # call notes + transcripts
├── 04 People/
├── 05 Projects/
├── 06 Research/
├── 07 References/
├── 08 Summaries/
├── _Templates/
├── _Attachments/       # drop ebooks/PDFs here before telling claude to summarize them
└── _Bases/             # optional, only if you use Obsidian Bases
```

Easy-mode install creates this structure for you. If you're using an existing vault, the skills prompt before creating any missing folders on first run. You can also rename any of them in the Configuration block at the top of each SKILL.md.

If you run Claude Code from outside your vault, set `VAULT_ROOT`:

```bash
export VAULT_ROOT="/path/to/vault"
```

Otherwise the skills walk up from your current directory looking for `.obsidian/`.

## Requirements

- `summarize` uses `yt-dlp`, `defuddle`, `pdftotext`, and `pandoc`
- `summarize-call` uses `ffmpeg` (always), plus either `mlx_whisper` + `pyannote.audio` (local path) or an `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (cloud path)

Each skill checks what's missing on first run and asks before installing anything.

## Tested on

- macOS 15 (Darwin 25) on Apple Silicon, Python 3.11+, Claude Code CLI
- Local transcription path assumes a Mac with MPS; the skill auto-detects CUDA / MPS / CPU and falls back to CPU on unsupported devices (slower but functional)
- ElevenLabs Scribe path works on any OS with Python + `requests`
